# Artist-Viz: Exploring Artists and Exhibitions 

The ArtVis dataset is derived from the Database of Modern Exhibitions [DoME](http://exhibitions.univie.ac.at/)  from the University of Vienna. It contains about 14.000 modern painters and their exhibitions between 1905 and 1915.

This repository contains a dataset and visualization dashboard that explores the relationships between artists and exhibitions during the years 1905â€“1915. The dataset integrates detailed artist information (e.g., name, gender, nationality, birth/death dates) with exhibition characteristics (e.g., title, type, location, year, and number of paintings). 

## Key Features
- **Artist Data**: Includes demographics (gender, nationality) and life events (birth/death dates and places).  
- **Exhibition Data**: Covers exhibition type (solo/group/auction), location (city, country, coordinates), year, and artworks presented.  
- **Diversity and Trends**: Enables the exploration of artist representation, participation, and historical exhibition patterns across different locations and formats.

## Target Users
This project is designed for **researchers**, **curators**, and **art historians** to analyze trends, diversity, and participation in early 20th-century art events.
